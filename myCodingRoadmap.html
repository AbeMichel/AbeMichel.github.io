        <h1>How I would learn computer science if I had to do it over.</h1>
        <section>
            <br>
            Computer science is an extremely broad field that is full of intricate specialties. 
            Because of this I find it difficult to recommend any one person start at the same place as another, 
            but for the purpose of higher education and the nature of formal education being for the general 
            student rather than any specific one I've put together a roadmap. Methods to achieve the goals 
            listed could be altered and, realistically, the order could be completely different. Without further 
            ado, here is the way I would learn computer science if I did it again.

                    <h3>Intro to Programming</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Learning Objectives:</b>
                            Loops, variables, ordered execution.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Method(s):</b>
                            <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="noopener noreferrer">Scratch</a> (Or similar program).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Reasoning:</b>
                            Many people I've worked with don't have a great understanding of the 
                            basic building blocks of programs such as loops, variables, etc. The 
                            reason I put this first is because these structures, for the most part, 
                            are agnostic of the language you code in. This gives people an opportunity 
                            to begin thinking about the world in a computational way. My recommendation 
                            for a tool for this stage is the Scratch program/website from MIT. This is because 
                            it doesn't require any device setup aside from having a web browser and there 
                            have been plenty of studies that show that this visual programming transitions 
                            well into written languages.

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Web Programming</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Learning Objectives:</b>
                            Version Control, IDEs, written syntax, debugging, libraries.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Method(s):</b>
                            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code, GitHub, CDNs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Reasoning:</b>
                            Because all you need is a text editor and a web browser to run 
                            your basic code, web programming offers a light-weight way of 
                            getting into written programs rather than the block-based programming 
                            like Scratch. The simplicity of file structure and organization 
                            in web programming allows for the introduction of development tools 
                            like Visual Studio Code and GitHub. A big motivator for GitHub being 
                            here is because it offers a free website hosting which will enable 
                            people to begin their portfolio websites early in their journey.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Data Structures & Algorithms</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Learning Objectives:</b>
                            Error codes, OOP, Big O, Structures, Search/Sorting Algorithms.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Method(s):</b>
                            C++, C, C#.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Reasoning:</b>
                            As people begin to start making more complex projects they will need 
                            to have a deeper understanding of tried and true algorithms and 
                            strategies for manipulating data. This is a great time to introduce 
                            complexity and optimization as some algorithms can be awfully expensive 
                            or inefficient. The reason I'm recommending one of the C languages here 
                            is because they are fairly unforgiving when it comes to data structures 
                            whereas languages like Python and JavaScript have a way of just kind of 
                            working despite bad code. The strictness of the languages will provide 
                            ample opportunity for learning how to read error messages if that is 
                            still a skill that is lacking.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Computer Organization & Architecture</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Learning Objectives:</b>
                            Binary, Computer Hardware.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Method(s):</b>
                            Language of Choice, Hardware Labs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Reasoning:</b>
                            This follows most of the software classes because I've found it 
                            much simpler to imagine what the hardware is doing after having 
                            a more “abstract” idea of it in software. I wouldn't doubt that 
                            this may be the opposite for others, but in my experience, this 
                            is the preferred order.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Any of the following in any order (Interest dependent)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Operating Systems</li>
                        <li>Computer Graphics</li>

                        <li>Database Programming</li>
                    </ul>
