                <p>
                    At John Deere (Deere & Company), I worked as a software test architect on the 
                    Obstacle Intelligence (OI) team. When I joined, the team was small, consisting 
                    of just my team lead and me. This was a blessing, as I was 
                    trusted with my own projects. My primary responsibilities included writing, 
                    executing, and reviewing test plans for software used on various types of heavy machinery 
                    used on construction sites. I also maintained and developed tools for 
                    use within the team and department.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    During my time at Deere, I gained invaluable experience. I learned how to 
                    collaborate with overseas colleagues and navigate the challenges of 
                    differing time zones. I became familiar with Scrum, discovering that a 
                    "sprint," despite the name, doesn't involve running on a track. One of the 
                    most important lessons I learned was the “golden rule” of development: 
                    when estimating how long a something will take, double your original estimate—twice. 
                    I also learned the importance of saying no when your plate is full, and I realized 
                    just how crucial it is to document every step of the testing process. Even seemingly 
                    insignificant details, such as whether the A/C was running when there was a defect in
                    the AI, can come back up.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    One of my favorite "treats" of working at John Deere was operating the machines. While I had
                    operated some of the smaller things like skidsteers or excavators before, it was a whole new experience to be 
                    driving a massive articulated dump truck 
                    (<a href="https://www.deere.com/en/articulated-dump-trucks/460-p-adt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="external-link">Photo</a>)
                    or navigating the complex controls of a grader 
                    (Photo of a <a href="https://www.deere.ca/en/motor-graders/772g-motor-grader/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="external-link">grader</a>

                    I loved going up to the Hill (the testing grounds) with the job of "breaking" the software. All in all 
                    I got trained on 6 different machines, my favorite being the loader

                <p>
                    This position has shown me how much I LOVE to teach. I was lucky enough
                    to be asked to be a supplemental instructor for 3 classes last year:
                    Physics I, Physics II, and Intro to Robotics. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    For physics I held sessions 2-3 times a week outside of the normal class time
                    for students who wanted to get additional work in. This was my own class of 
                    sorts—one I was able to work on my skills as an educator and rediscover my love of physics.
                    I was able to empathize with the students 
                    because they were going through the same "How the heck am I going to find the velocity
                    of this" that I went through. This not only gave me insight into how to
                    talk to them, but let me understand how much they actually understood when asking
                    questions. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    That was an important thing—they didn't just want answers to a
                    homework problem (well, some of them did)—they wanted to understand the
                    concept. That principle guided how I taught. I would rarely tell them the
                    way they wanted to do it was wrong and instead would guide them in debunking
                    or proving their methods. Most of my answers became questions, encouraging them
                    to think critically.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    For Intro to Robotics, I helped with labs, occasionally teaching them myself. This was a
                    blast as I got to see the various ways students wired their circuits or organized their
                    code and compare it to how I did when testing the lab. Even better I was able to give
                    students who had a solid understanding of the course additional challenges to push their critical
                    thinking skills. That was something I've always liked in classes so I tried to apply it to my teaching.

                <br/>
                <p>
                    When I took an astronomy course in high school, I expected to learn about
                    constellations and horoscopes—it turns out that's astrology and what I was in for is much
                    more scientific. Luckily, I loved the class, which led to me joining the Planetarium Club 
                    by the end of my 1st year of college. Eventually, I became president.
                    I had no idea what I was in for, so it was quite the surprise when I was asked if I wanted 
                    to sign up for a show after the first meeting.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Shows were ran by teams of 2 to 5 people and presenting to crowds averaging 60 people
                    and maxing out around 90 (only because we ran out of seats). The first few shows were nerve-wracking 
                    as I stuttered through my facts about Mars, but as time went on, I grew confident enough to throw in some
                    jokes and engage with audience a bit more. Because we were a small club and the professor
                    knew I enjoyed working with computers I also got to control the planetarium projector for the shows.
                    There was a lot that you could do with the projector that we weren't taking advantage of, and after a bit of
                    experimentation I was able to work more into the shows. This was great. Shows became a lot more dynamic and fun
                    for both the audiences and us. We began to increase the marketing of our shows which inevitably led to
                    more interest in the already packed shows, so much so that we would often do 2 performances in the same
                    night to accomedate.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    My absolute favorite moments were when we'd project the northern lights or a stunning nebula on
                    the dome, and kids would fill the room with "oooo"s and "ahhhh"s. It was a magical feeling that further
                    grew my passion for education. Other pretty awesome experiences I had included working with accomplished Loras alumni

                    Being a residential advisor brings a ton of opportunity to make a difference
                    in the lives of those around you. For many students, moving away from home—often
                    for the first time—can be a stressful or anxiety-inducing experience. Being able to help
                    make that transition easier for people is extremely rewarding. While staying up
                    on duty wasn't always fun, every time someone would walk in needing to talk
                    or de-stress, it made it worth it. The position also gave me the opportunity to meet 
                    people outside of the wrestling team, and some of my closest friendships were formed
                    through residence life.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The position was a mix of on-call counseler, mediator, custodian, event director,
                    safety monitor, and at times, what felt like a parent (Yes, you do need to add water before microwaving your mac and cheese).
                    Through our pre-semester training and hands-on experience, I learned how to handle a variety of situations,
                    largely growing my interest in communication and emotion science.

                    These events gave me a chance to connect with people I otherwise may not have got to
                    interact with and it was awesome to see the smile on their faces when you say hi to them around campus.
