        </h1>
        <p>
            <span id="intro">
                My name is <span id="name">Abe</span>,
            </span>
            <br/>
            I love learning, I love being challenged, and
            I love helping others do the same. College has provided 
            me with countless opportunities to pursue these passions, and it is
            this journey that drives my ambition to become a professor.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            My goals revolve around creating a joyous and loving world. I believe that starting in my own little 
            corner—even if it's just with one person—can inspire others to do the same. At Loras, I've worked as a 
            <a href="experience.html#si">supplemental instructor</a>
            for Physics 1, Physics 2, and Intro to Robotics, where I fell in love with teaching. I've contributed to the
            community by volunteering at the Dubuque Arboretum and Botanical Gardens, helping create a beautiful space for people 
            to relax and enjoy nature, and back home at my old high school leading practices
            for the wrestling team. I've also volunteered at the <a href="experience.html#planetarium">Heitkamp Planetarium</a>, 
            giving educational presentations to local schools and clubs. Additionally, I work to combat the stigma surrounding mental 
            health by pioneering and leading "Mindset Meetings" for the Loras wrestling team. These meetings provide a safe space 
            for the team to discuss mental challenges related to school, athletics, and life.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            I went to college with the intention of graduating early with a degree in engineering but quickly fell in love with
            the academic environment of college. This love for learning led me to prusue a double major in
            electro-mechanical engineering and computer science with minors in psychology, mathematics,
            physics, and analytics.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Through this journey, I've come to appreciate the value of an interdiciplinary education. Whether
            it's understanding the psychology of users while developing software or the physics behind the
            product you're marketing, broadening our learning deepens our understanding of the world we live in.
            I belive that learning about something leads to caring about it, which breaks down barriers to making an impact.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            <h2>Coding</h2>
            I get lost in coding. Hours can go by without me noticing and I love it. Most of the projects I work on are in pursuit
            of learning, whether it's about something like 
            <a href="Projects/ASLRecognition.html">ASL and machine learning</a>,
            <a href="Projects/FacialRecognition.html">facial recognition</a>, or
            <a href="Projects/LinkedInToCV.html">web scraping</a>.
            My coding journey began senior year of high school when I got to take an experimental class covering SolidWORKS and
            Unity Engine (C#) where I made <a href="Projects/ChopWoodCarryWater.html">my first game</a>. The following couple years
            consisted of <a href="Projects/SmallGames.html">prototyping small games</a> until I attempted 
            <a href="Projects/FacialRecognition.html">facial recognition</a> as a means of learning Python. This expansion from C# led
            to an eagerness to explore other languages, so I started doing some LeetCode problems to learn C++. Eventually, I had a very supportive
            friend who sent me a job posting for a position as a <a href="experience.html#jd">software test architect at John Deere</a>. While this was an engineering position it quickly
            convinced me to add computer science as a major. My love for coding has only grown since.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            <h2>Wrestling</h2>
            I originally didn't have wrestling as it's own section, but it's had such a profound impact on my life that I
            couldn't leave it out. Much of who I am is because of wrestling, and that goes far beyond "wrestling made me tough." It shaped
            how I approach learning—with a playful and open mind—and influenced the relationships I've built. While this may be
            something that can be said about many sports, I found it in wrestling. The community you become a part of is incredibly welcoming and vibrant.
            <br/>

            <div class="img-group">
                <div class="img-and-desc">
                    <img src="Assets/AboutMe/WrestlingGroup1.jpg"/>
                    <p></p>
                </div>
                <div class="img-and-desc">

                </div>
            </div>
            <br/>
            With all the highs that come from wrestling, there are just as many lows, and I think that's what makes it special. There's
            no one else to blame other than yourself, and while humbling, it's also empowering. Although your success is all on you, no one
            can succeed at a high level on their own. This applies everywhere. Just as you need a partner or coach to push you when
            things get hard; a teacher, friend, or collegue can help you chase your goals or overcome the next obstacle. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I've had so many influential coaches, friends, and teammates that are largely responsible for why I am where I am today. 
            My appreciation for them is why I strive to give back to the community that has given so much to me. I love going back to my high school to
            show technique and talk with old coaches. This same passion drives me in education—I want to be able to give back. I've
            begun giving back through my role as a <a href="experience.html#si">supplemental instructor</a>, and it's this same desire to
            inspire, mentor, and empower others that drives my dream of becoming a professor. Just as wrestling shaped who I am, I want to
            help shape those who come after me.

            <h3>Creating</h3>
            I love to make things regardless of the medium. There's something special about making something from nothing that
            makes me really happy. Below is a collection of little creations that didn't make the

            <h3>Reading</h3>
            Books have been a significant part of my life. When I was little, I would go out and explore the
            world, only to rush back inside and look up the curious creatures I encountered in my National Audubon
            Society field guides. Reading turned hour-long bus rides to school into adventures I couldn't wait to
            immerse myself in. When I reached high school, one of my coaches would recommend books on mindset, philosophy,
            and athletic performance, which ignited my passion for psychology. In college, I found myself
            reading about stoicism and Marcus Aurelius' journel to discuss with my teammates. Much of who I am today is
            because of books.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <ul style="list-style-position: inside;">
                A short list of books I highly recommend,
                <li><i>Mastery</i> by Robert Greene</li>
                <li><i>Nonviolent Communication</i> by Dr. Marshall B. Rosenberg</li>
                <li><i>Gates of Fire</i> by Steven Pressfield</li>
                <li><i>The Daily Stoic</i> by Ryan Holiday</li>

            <h3>Cooking & Travel</h3>
            Growing up in a small town in Iowa, it was always a treat to go to another town and eat new food.
            I find food to be a glimpse into the lives of the people who live in an area which is 
            why I love cooking. I feel that I'm able to share a part of myself through the food I make.
            The architecture of different places tell stories in a similar way. The quiant countryside of Italy
            tells a vastly different story than the rural farm houses of Iowa.
            Below are some photos of some of the wonderful food and places I've made and experienced.
