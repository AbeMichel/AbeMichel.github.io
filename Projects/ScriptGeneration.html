                Another fun project I worked on at Deere involved developing a 
                Python automation script that generated secondary scripts to handle
                incoming MQTT messages encoded in custom Protobuf (Protocol Buffer)
                formats. I really enjoyed the challenge of working with various 
                variables, especially the complexity of nested repeated variables, 
                while keeping the code clean and readable. I found that manually 
                doing the task first and breaking it down into small, clear steps 
                as comments made coding the solution much easier.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                By building a scalable and well-structured base, I was able to 
                extend the functionality to handle imported or referenced Protobuf 
                files as well. This allowed the script to automatically search the 
                node modules folder for any imported files, further streamlining 
                the process. The automation significantly reduced the workload 
                compared to manually writing scripts and minimized the risk of 
                errors.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Through this project, I gained a solid understanding of MQTT and 
                Protobuf, learned a lot about string parsing, and even got some 
                experience with GitHub pull requests. I also improved my skills 
                in creating a maintainable and flexible codebase, making future 
                work much easier.
