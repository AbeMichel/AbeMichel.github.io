                As I've progressed through school and began looking into next steps, whether that be a job in industry or
                going to graduate school, there is one thing that has always bugged me: whenever I update my projects or
                something on LinkedIn I have to go update it in the correct format on my CV and Resume. I started looking into ways
                to interface with LinkedIn and found that the free methods are fairly limited to web scraping. This was a fun little endeavor
                where I got to learn about the pain that is scraping dynamicly generated webpages. After a bit of trial and error I found a reliable way of
                gathering the information I needed and just had to put it into to a Microsoft Word document. Luckily, there was a library 
                (<a href="https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">pydocx</a>) that made it relatively easy to code the 
                format I use in my handmade resume. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <div class="img-group">
                    <div class="img-and-desc">
                        <img src="../Assets/LinkedInToCV/CV_Screenshot.png" alt="screenshot of a generated cv"/>
                        <p>A snippet of the generated CV format</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <br/>
                There came an issue where LinkedIn started asking if I was a robot and obviously my robot didn't know how
                to handle it, so I just pause the program until the URL is the LinkedIn feed and ask the user to lend some 
                help in completing that nasty CAPTCHA. Another problem I ran into was the profile page not showing all of a
                section if it was too long, so I changed the code slightly to navigate straight to the detailed pages for 
                the three sections I was scraping.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                There are some improvements I would like to make to this if I continue work on it:
                <ul style="list-style: inside;">
                    <li>Improve the speed of the scraping</li>
                    <li>Support the rest of the profile sections</li>
                    <li>Use AI or fuzzy-matching to cater a resume to a job listing</li>
                </ul>
                <br/>
                NOTE: After a brief google search while
                writing this I see there are quite a few solutions, but I stand by my method because it keeps the format I like.
