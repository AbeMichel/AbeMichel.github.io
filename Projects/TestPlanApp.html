            <p>
                The first month of working at <a href="experience.html#jd">John Deere</a> came with a lot of learning which
                meant I was a little slower at doing things than other people who'd already been working there. A big one was writing
                test plans for <a href="Projects/AIEnabledMovement.html">AI enabled movement on heavy machinery</a>. This was done in MS Excel and
                if you've ever worked in Excel, you'd know that it boasts some amazing quality of life features and customization, but there
                was one thing that really interupted my workflow: having to take my hand off the keyboard to use the mouse to change my position
                in the text because the arrow keys in Excel just move your cell. I continued to work despite the terrible (very minor) inconviences
                attributed to this. That is until I realized we were allowed to create tools for our jobs. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The goal was to create an application with the process of testing in mind. I took inspiration from the good parts of Excel,
                <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="external-link">Trello</a>, and my limited experience testing. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <ul style="list-style: inside;">
                    The application boasted the following features:
                    <li>Import existing test plans made in Excel</li>
                    <li>Export to the Excel format</li>
                    <li>Read, parse, and sort requirement documents</li>
                    <li>Track test results and defects</li>
                    <li>Full functionality without moving the mouse</li>
                </ul>
                <br/>
                After a few iterations I used this as my primary way of writing and executing test plans.
                A challenge I encountered was learning how to create a GUI for the application as I'd never
                done something like that before. Fortunately, I had professionals in UX (user experience) and UI (user interface)
                surrounding my cubicle, along with a very supportive team lead to test and give feedback on development.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Having primarily worked on school and personal projects, I developed a deep attachment to the 
                quality and outcomes of my work. No one told me, however, that <b class="lesson" id="l0">when it comes to workplace projects, 
                the level of personal investment needs to be managed differently</b>. I took great pride in this project
                and truly enjoyed the development process. However, since it belonged to the company, they 
                ultimately decided to set it aside in favor of a commercial solution.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Although this project ended up being replaced, the experience was invaluable. I learned a lot about
                UI/UX design and the testing process. My work also caught the eye of management, which led to
                being assigned other projects such as <a href="Projects/ScriptGeneration.html">MQTT Script Generation</a> 
                and <a href="Projects/TestResultReporting.html">Automated Test Result Reporting</a>.
