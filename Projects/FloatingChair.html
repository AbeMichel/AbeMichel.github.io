                There are so many cool projects that I see online and think, "That looks awesome! I kind of want to make one."
                This was one of those. The goal of the project was to create a cool-looking bar stool where the seat is 
                held solely by chains. Right away, you might think, "There's no way to have a chair held up by only chains" and
                you'd be right... if you weren't wrong.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <div class="img-group">
                    <div class="img-and-desc">
                        <img src="../Assets/FloatingChair/FloatingChair.jpg" alt="A photo of the bar stool"/>
                        <p>The bar stool freshly assembled</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <br/>
                Because the black is fairly difficult to differentiate I've marked up the image a bit:
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <div class="img-group">
                    <div class="img-and-desc">
                        <img src="../Assets/FloatingChair/NoTopChair.jpg" alt="A photo of the bar stool without the seat"/>
                        <p>The frame prior to attaching the seat</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="img-and-desc">
                        <img src="../Assets/FloatingChair/MarkedUpChair.png" alt="A photo of the bar stool marked up"/>
                        <p>Pink is the top half; Blue the bottom; Orange are stabilizing chains; Green is the support chain</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <br/>
                There were a few parts to making this, the first being the frame. It's made of rusty pipes and chain I found lying around
                and cleaned up using an angle grinder. The frame is TIG welded together and the bottom of the chain is anchored using the same.
                The top of the chain is connected using eye hooks to allow for a customizable "wobble" of the seat. After assembling the frame
                it was spray painted then detailed with a brush. The seat is made from cedar, shaped using a router, sanded and stained to achieve a nice contrast 
                to the solid black frame, and finally connected to the frame with screws.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I was very happy with how it turned out! There was a bit more designing I wish I would've alotted time for, but that's really all I would change.
