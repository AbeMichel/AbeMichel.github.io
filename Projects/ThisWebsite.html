                This is my first attempt at creating a website in pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I chose to host it in GitHub pages as I've worked with them
                <a href="TestResultReporting.html">previously</a> at <a href="../experience.html#jd">Deere</a> and found it to be very convienent (and free).
                There was a multi-faceted purpose to this project: I wanted to learn more about frontend development and I thought it would better convey who
                I am as a person than a resume or CV would in my graduate school applications. The thought of making a website came about 2 weeks ago (from the time
                I'm writing this on 9/21/2024) while reviewing professors I'd be interested in studying under and noticing how much easier it was when they had
                a personal website.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                There are a few things I've already come to love about frontend development: JavaScript and its control is a lot of fun, CSS has an absurd amount of
                properties that I have spent hours playing with, and I've had a blast using my browser's dev tools on different websites to see how they do things. 
                Conversely, there has been one thing that has ate at me throughout this development and that's not being able to do client side includes. I think I can
                use JavaScript's fetch() function to do so, but in testing browsers get upset and throw errors because of limited file access, so I've avoided it. I also
                considered using Python to build the HTML files for me, but the development time of that would far exceed any copy and pasting I have to do (for now at least).
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Overall, I've really enjoyed making this site. I'm glad I have an accessible, and frankly less professional (compared to a CV), place to show what I've accomplished over the last
                4 years. I want to continue iterating and improving the underlying code for this site, but after reaching the end of my first iteration, I'm pretty excited to take a break
                and read a book I picked up a bit ago, "<i>JavaScript: The Good Parts</i>" by Douglas Crockford, and look back at this and laugh as everything I've done is slowly torn apart throughout the book.
