            <p>
                Writing immersive dialogue for a video game is a daunting task and it kept me from making much progress
                on <a href="Projects/RPG.html">my dream game</a> for a while. But there's a funny way that ideas come out of 
                no where. I was working on the <a href="Projects/ScriptGeneration.html">MQTT message parsing</a> for <a href="experience.html#jd">Deere</a> which
                involved a lot of string parsing and that gave me both the inspiration and know how to finally attempt to
                create a dialogue writing system of my own. I iterated on it a few times, but landed on a very simple format
                for writing dialogue and even added in functionality to support commands and conditionals.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Not only was the development of this language enjoyable (it felt a little like a I was making my own coding language), but
                it became fun to write dialogue and has saved me a lot of time doing so. For a while I was <b class="lesson" id="l0">adding in more
                functionality than I actually needed</b> which I had a blast doing, but wasted quite a bit of time on things I wasn't going to or couldn't use
                and after creating a few of them I realized what I was doing and cut myself off on development for the time being. 
                Yet again scope creep had snuck in and claimed precious time.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Through this development I grew a lot more comfortable with string
                parsing in C# (most of my previous experience had been in Python) and further reinforced my love for writing documentation.
                Below I've included a download for the text file I put together as documentation and an example dialogue to showcase the simple yet
                expansive capabilities of the language.
                <br/>

                <a href="Downloadables/Dialogue System Guide.txt">Download Full Dialogue Guide</a>
                <br/>
                There are a few formatting rules that you should be aware of before reading the dialogue below:
                <ul style="list-style: inside;">
                    <li>'{}' Curly brackets hold file variables such as the name of the speaker.</li>
                    <li>'-' Indicates the start of a new dialogue block</li>
                    <li>'_' Indicates a choice given after the previous dialogue block is shown.</li>
                    <li>'[]' Square brackets above a dialogue block or choice hold parameters.</li>
                </ul>
                <br/>
                <h1>Example Dialogue File</h1>
                <pre class="code">
                    <code>

# this is just a comment so it won't be shown

-Would you like to buy this item for 5 gold?
[next=sold]
_Yes please!
[next=notake]
_No thanks!

# if the vender sold an item we should give it to the player
[id=sold, req=gold take 5 > poorboy, end=true, checkpoint=allout, cmd=item g 0]
-Wonderful! It's all yours!

# if the player didn't want to take the item
[id=notake, end=true]
-Unfortunate... 
It's wonderful sword :(

# if the player didn't have enough gold for the item
[id=poorboy, end=true]
-Aww come back when you have enough gold.

# once the item is sold
[id=allout, end=true]
-Thanks again for buying that!
