                'Chop Wood, Carry Water' was a game I made during a coding class I took in high school. 
                This was my introduction to coding and game development and as such holds a near and dear
                place in my heart. The idea of the game is inspired by the book I was reading for football, 
                "<a href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/28405277-chop-wood-carry-water">Chop Wood Carry Water: How to Fall In Love With the Process of Becoming Great</a>".
                The gameplay loop consists of having to collect enough resources (wood and water) while being pursued by an enemy.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Since this was part of my introduction to programming I wasn't prepared for a lot of the issues associated with
                development and looking back I let scope creep do a lot more than creep. I started adding day and night modes and various POVs to name
                a few. I've since learned to <b class="lesson" id="l0">define the goals/purpose of the project early</b> to avoid
                serious scope creep. Though some people might say that any scope creep is too much scope creep, I think 
                <b class="lesson" id="l1">leaving a little room for additional material can inspire unforeseen creativity</b>.

                            The menu for the game. 
                            Though hard to see here you may notice that there is no 'quit' option
                            and as it is a fullscreen game this causes some issues. Unfortunately, covid-19 had taken over
                            and I never got feedback on this so I continued to develop fullscreen applications with no quit button for a while...

                There isn't much more to say about this game. It was a lot of learning: the first time I had tried coding, the first time I used
                Unity Engine, the first time I ever really thought about game development from a perspective other than a player's. My two biggest take aways 
                from this experience are that <b class="lesson" id="l2">it is important to explore and try new things</b>, I found my love for
                game development and computer science, and <b class="lesson" id="l3">the only way you truly fail is if you didn't learn anything or have fun doing so</b>.
