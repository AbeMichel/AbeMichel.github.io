                The title of this project (or a series of projects) is fancy verbage
                for "wrote, executed, and reviewed test plans while trying to run stuff over with giant
                machines" which was A LOT of fun. If all things went right I would be halted to a stop before
                hitting the poor unsuspecting mannequin.

                While I enjoyed the actual testing of software, a lot of the job was looking at the bits and verifying the correct ones would
                flip when doing specific things. This got really confusing a couple times when trying to remember if I wrote the test in big or
                little-endian which brings us to my first lesson while doing this: <b class="lesson" id="l0">details matter</b>.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In 8th grade, when I was thinking that it was silly we were
                writing detailed tests for simple procedures, I never would
                have thought that that would be a large part of what I did for a job, 
                but as it turns out I really enjoy it. There was a bit of a learning curve when
                starting to write test plans but I quickly learned that 
                <b class="lesson" id="l1">just because I knew what something meant doesn't mean others will too</b>, it became a game
                to see how conscise and detailed I could make a test step. This is also where "ensuring" and "verifying" began to mean different
                things to me. The time I spent writing test plans led me to long for something more than what Excel could give me (mainly being able to "ctrl+left" to traverse sentences in a cell)
                and so I began developing <a href="TestPlanApp.html">my first tool</a> at <a href="../experience.html#jd">Deere</a>.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                These projects were also the purpose of most of the meetings I was involved in. We had practiced a Scrum-like framework which at first was
                a lot to take in, but after a few google searches and a couple sprints I enjoyed the process.
