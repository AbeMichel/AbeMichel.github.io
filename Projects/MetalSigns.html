                These signs were designed using CorelDRAWX7, cut using a CNC plasma table, and either painted or stained for color.
                All but one of the signs were made with the sole purpose of being a gift while the American flag was made as a commission.
                The first time I tried making one of these was senior year of high school and I instantly loved the process. It was incredibly
                rewarding to start with a piece of scrap metal and slowly transform it into something unique and meaningful.

                    <li>Use the plasma table to cut the metal</li>
                    <li>Grind the metal (<a href="https://youtu.be/wfyvTsw1gXw?si=NIT8gfPs2lcUSYDi&t=66">Here's a Youtube video of what that looks like</a>)</li>
                    <li>Use sandpaper to further prep the surface</li>
                    <li>Tape off the design with painter's tape</li>
                    <li>Paint (I used spray paint) or stain</li>
                    <li>Let dry and apply a clear coat</li>

                <br/>
                One of my favorite parts of the process by far was designing the cuts; it was a great mix of free creativity and restriction from the medium.
                It took a cut or two before I fully understood that you can't just throw text on a design without being incredibly deliberate in connecting all the
                pieces with supports.

            <h1 id="carpenter-story">The Carpenter's House - Unknown Author</h1>
            <a href="#carpenter-ref">Back to reading</a>
            <p>
                An elderly carpenter was ready to retire. He told his employer-contractor of his plans to leave the house building business 
                and live a more leisurely life with his wife enjoying his extended family.
                He would miss the paycheck, but he needed to retire. They could get by. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The contractor was sorry to see his good worker go 
                and asked if he could build just one more house as a personal favor. 
                The carpenter said yes, but in time it was easy to see that his heart was not in his work. 
                He resorted to shoddy workmanship and used inferior materials. It was an unfortunate way to end his career.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                When the carpenter finished his work and the builder came to inspect the house, the contractor handed the front-door key to the carpenter. 
                "This is your house," he said, "my gift to you."
                What a shock! What a shame! If he had only known he was building his own house, he would have done it all so differently. 
                Now he had to live in the home he had built none too well.
